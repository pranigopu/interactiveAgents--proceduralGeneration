## Case Study Topic Selection
The topic relates to the AI systems of a game, or a pair of games, i.e. the interactive agents and/or procedural content generators developed as part of the game(s). The aim of the case study is to gain a better understanding of how AI systems are used in industry by studying a particular example in depth. The available topics are:

- Topics in Interactive Agents
    - AI Companions in Bioshock Infinite and The Last of Us
    - The NPC AI of Horizon Zero Dawn
    - AI Directors in Left 4 Dead and Alien: Isolation
- Topics in Procedural Content Generation
    - Procedural Generation in Caves of Qud
    - Procedural Generation in Unexplored
    - Procedural Generation in No Man's Sky

**MY CHOSEN TOPIC**: Procedural Generation in Unexplored

## Case Study Content and Format
The case study should be based on appropriate sources, ex. papers, blog posts or videos that describe the AI systems, and referenced appropriately. You use the following section structure.

### Introduction
Introduce the game(s) and the specific AI system(s) the case study discusses.

### The Game
- Describe the role of the AI systems within the game or games' overall design.
- What requirements did this design place on these AI system(s)?
- Mention any specific constraints or challenges (hardware, development, etc).

### System Design
- Explain the technical details of how the AI system(s) are designed and operate in this game. Focus in particular on aspects which are specific to this game.
- Provide specific examples/scenarios to illustrate their operation.

### Industry Context
- Compare these AI systems to standard approaches used in the games industry, and approaches used in comparable games.

### Conclusions
- Summarise the key points of your case study.
- Reflect on the overall success or failure of the AI system(s) in this game or games.
    - Do you think they satisfy the overall goals the designers had? Why or why not?
    - How do they compare with other games?
    - What do you think could be improved upon?

### References
- A list of references used (those provided in the topic description and any others used). <br> **NOTE**: These should follow a recognised format: <br> https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=653429&chapterid=66172 <br> This link is to a QMUL book on literacy skills that may be useful!

## Marking criteria
- Diagrams are not included in the word limit.
- Reports over the word limit will be assessed on the first 3000 words only.
- The case study (marked out of 100) will be assessed on:
    - Technical description (40 marks)
    - Placement/context of AI within the game design (15 marks)
    - Context of AI within Industry (15 marks)
    - Reflection (10 marks)
    - Overall Presentation (Clarity, language, layout, overall coherence) (15 marks)
    - Quality of references (5 marks)

## Pre-submission checks
- Did you check which topic you were allocated?
- Have you appropriately referenced your sources?
- Have you described the AI systems in your own words, and not plagiarised the sources? <br> **HINT**: _You can upload your submission to QMPlus on the submission page before the deadline and it will generate a plagiarism report for you to double check you haven't inadvertently plagiarised. Pay attention to the matched content rather than the percentage similarity. For example, the text in the references section will often match but this is fine._
- Is the case study between 2000 and 3000 words.
- Everything ready? Donâ€™t forget to hit submit.
